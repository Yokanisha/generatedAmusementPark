# Generated Amusement Park Project

This project was created for the final project of DataEngineering-ZoomCamp-2024.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to develop an end-to-end project after completing the ZoomCamp. It was important to utilize certain technologies that are of great significance to a Data Engineer. Since I couldn't find suitable data of personal interest in a short amount of time, nor suitable data models to develop, I decided to generate my own data.

## Overview
In this project, we received data from a new amusement park in Germany that has been operating for over a year. To obtain a clear overview of all the generated data, an end-to-end project was created to visualize the data and provide a comprehensive overview. The data is stored in GitHub. First, an overview of the data model will be provided, followed by the process from data extraction to visualization. The goal is to automate everything once the project is set up. For this purpose, the following technologies and tools were used:

Cloud - [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=de)

Containerization - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Data build tool - [Dbt_cloud](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt)

Data Lake - [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage?hl=de)

Data Visualization - [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/navigation/reporting)

Data Warehouse - [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/?hl=de&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=emea-de-all-de-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-gcp-1707574&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_554507997073-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+BKWS+-+EXA+%7C+Txt+-+Data+Analytics+-+BigQuery-KWID_43700072687751150-kwd-12297987241-userloc_9044716&utm_term=KW_big%20query-NET_g-PLAC_&&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_LOwBhBFEiwAmSEQASbDWmL37ZnYTiF1i6c2uAxtPjz_p1DwuqN0-AvAHBjXPHmeu-SgBRoCYSEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
